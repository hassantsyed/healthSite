This is a django project which enables users to assemble health teams to help them reach their fitness goals.
Everything on the site was built by me.
It utilizes the bootstrap framework for the front end and a postgres database. It also has a complete user registration system.
It integrates a variety of technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python being the main pieces. Ajax is also heavily used.
